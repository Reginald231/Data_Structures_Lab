The purpose of this lab is to reinforce pointer concepts and to introduce a graphical debugger on cloudland. The standard linux debugger is gdb and ddd is a GUI built on top of gdb. We will use ddd. Some good references are

Your instructor will do a demo of ddd illustrating the most important capabilities which include:

how to load and run your program

how to set a breakpoint

how to step through your code

how to examine values of variables

how to access and interpret the stack trace


To use ddd (or any program with a graphical interface), windows users will have to have an x-server running on their windows machine and will have to tunnel the x-packets using port 22. You covered this in lab 1. After the demo, you need to download lab6.cpp, compile it, and then execute it on cloudland. This program contains a classic error involving pointers. You need to find and correct that error. Obviously, ddd is a tool that can help you.
