The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce graph implementations in C++. The author provides an implementation of a graph using an adjacency matrix. Another way to implement a graph is to just store the edges. This is done by using a set for each vertex. Each set will set the "ending" vertex of each edge starting at the specific vertex. For example, to store the edge <v1,v2>, v2 will be stored in the set associated with v1. This lab is to construct a graph class in which the edges are stored in adjacency sets. You need to use this header file and this test file.
