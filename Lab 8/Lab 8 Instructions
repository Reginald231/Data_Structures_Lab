The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce template class concepts in C++. Specifically, the lab to repeat the sequence lab from last week which used a linked list except that the template version of the node class as well as the template version of the sequence class will be used. You need to use the author's files sequence4.h, sequence_exam4.cpp, node2.h, and node2.template. You will need to construct sequence5.template.
