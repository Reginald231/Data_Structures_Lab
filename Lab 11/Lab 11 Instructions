The goal of this lab is to reinforce binary tree concepts. Specifically, this lab is to do construct a function (and construct a test program using a non-trivial tree) which will display a binary tree by levels showing “vacant spots”. The display for the following tree should be:


M

H T

E null P W

A null null null null Q null null


The function header should be:


template <typename T>

void display_complete_tree (const binary_tree_node<T>* t)
