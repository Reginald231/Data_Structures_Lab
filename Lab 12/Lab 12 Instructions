The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce heap and priority queue implementations in C++. Specifically, the lab is to problem 2 on page 582 of the text. Note that you will need to implement a heap class (use a vector instead of a dynamic array) and then use the heap class to implement a priority queue. You need to construct a test program to help test the correctness of your code. You need to use heap.h and priority_queue.h. Use test_heap.cpp and test_priority_queue.cpp as your test files.
